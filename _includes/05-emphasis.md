I'm a fan of the **IDLES** band, they're a punk band from *Bristol*, and they're pretty cool. In one of their songs, Grounds, there's a line *"Do you hear that thunder? that's the sound of strength in numbers"* In this instance, strength in numbers, refers to the power of the people when we come together for a common goal. Strength in numbers is also used in the crypto space, refering to the unbreakable power of math in cryptography. In bitcoin your money is protected by numbers.
